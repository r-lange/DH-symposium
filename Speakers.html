  <h3><strong>Haid Liang (NTU)</strong></h3> 
  <p>Professor Haida Linag received her PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics from ANU. After a few postdocs in astronomy she became a research fellow in the Scientific Department at the National Gallery, London, changing her research focus from observing the sky to imaging paintings. Following this she moved to Nottingham Trent University, UK, where she started her own group and is now the head of the Imaging & Sensing for Archaeology, Art History & Conservation (ISAAC) research group. Her work explores using non-invasive imaging techniques used in astronomy and medical imaging in the context of art conservation. In this capacity her lab developed several imaging systems for optical coherence tomography, multi-/hyper-spectral imaging and lightfastness testing of heritage objects.
Her many external collaborations include for example the National Gallery, London; Dunhuang Academy, China (Mogao Caves); Foundation Beyeler, Switzerland; Smithsonian Institute, USA; as well as industry, universities and research institutes worldwide.

Brief description:
This book explains how designing, playing and modifying computer games, and understanding the theory behind them, can strengthen the area of digital humanities. This book aims to help digital humanities scholars understand both the issues and also advantages of game design, as well as encouraging them to extend the field of computer game studies, particularly in their teaching and research in the field of virtual heritage. By looking at re-occurring issues in the design, playtesting and interface of serious games and game-based learning for cultural heritage and interactive history, this book highlights the importance of visualisation and self-learning in game studies and how this can intersect with digital humanities. It also asks whether such theoretical concepts can be applied to practical learning situations. It will be of particular interest to those who wish to investigate how games and virtual environments can be used in teaching and research to critique issues and topics in the humanities, particularly in virtual heritage and interactive history.

 <h3 id="beynon" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"><strong>David Beynon (Deakin) - Reflections on the Digital Modelling of Temples in South and Southeast Asia</strong></h3> 
  <p> The talk will present a broad multi-disciplinary examination of early temple architecture through  digital reconstruction and  reflect on its impact on the history and theory of Asian architecture. The authors will examine the archetypes of Early Brahmanic, Hindu and Buddhist temple architecture from their origins in north western India to their subsequent spread and adaptation eastwards into Southeast Asia. The compositional connections between their building traditions, especially the common themes and mutual influences in the early architecture of Java, Cambodia and Champa will be presented through digital reconstruction and recovery of three dimensional temple forms. The impact of digital datasets of early Indian antecedents, new technologies for the acquisition of built heritage and  new methods for comparative analysis of built form geometry will be examined.

  <h3 id="champion" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"><strong>Erik Champion - Bridging Creative Communities And Digital Heritage </strong></h3> 
  <p>This presentation will examine the critical and creative activities undertaken in hacker and maker communities, as well as in the related GLAM sector, in contrast to the achievements and challenges of digital heritage infrastructures, especially digital heritage using virtual reality and 3D digital models. Emerging research opportunities to integrate the engagement and outreach of the former with the technical developments of the latter will be outlined.

  <h3 id="westbrook" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;"><strong>Nigel Westbrook (UWA) - Forensic architecture: reconstructing historic architecture and urban environments from pre-modern visual records</strong></h3> 
  <p>My research employs the methodologies of architectural drawing, modeling and analysis, backed by historical knowledge and methodology to undertake experimental reconstructions of lost buildings and urban environments—'forensic architecture'. Traditionally, architectural history and theory have concerned themselves with the existing—projects that exist as standing buildings, or as more-or-less well documented unbuilt or demolished buildings. These form the 'landmarks' of our architectural history. Thus, for example, Hagia Sophia and the Pantheon form key 'moments' in this history, not least because they physically exist, and have been extensively documented, so that if they disappeared in a calamity they would still exist as part of the historical record and the canon of architecture as 'Great Moments'. Such projects appear 'permanent'—despite the actual transformations that time has made to them. Surviving unbuilt projects similarly convey a finite character that hides the transformations that inevitably would occur if the project had been built, while record photographs and drawings generally depict the monument at one point in time. But what of monuments and urban configurations which have disappeared, both physically, and from the record? Can they still be considered within the framework of architecture? Perhaps, they might have served as models, exerting enormous influence on later architecture. Thus, we have the historic example of San Marco in Venice, whereas we have lost the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, which its builders emulated. In such cases, frequently the only evidence can be supplied by archaeology and by ancient textual descriptions, from which scholars must interpret and hypothesise. For such tasks, the methodology of architecture- the understanding of structure, space and spatial narrative—the movement through environments—can often be an effective tool. Thus, architectural methods have been used within or in collaboration with other disciplines in research projects, notably with historians and archaeologists in studying the ways in which urban environments and architectural ensembles (evidence of material culture) have developed and transformed. Furthermore, current digital technologies can be used both to extract evidence from historical representations, and to simulate the temporal environment created by spatial sequences through which rituals might proceed.
